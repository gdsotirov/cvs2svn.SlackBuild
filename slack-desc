cvs2svn: cvs2svn (tool for converting cvs repositories)
cvs2svn:
cvs2svn: cvs2svn is a tool for migrating a CVS repository to Subversion,
cvs2svn: git, or Bazaar.  The main design goals are robustness and 100% data
cvs2svn: preservation.
cvs2svn: cvs2svn infers what happened in the history of your CVS repository
cvs2svn: and replicates that history as accurately as possible in the target
cvs2svn: SCM.  All revisions, branches, tags, log messages, author names,
cvs2svn: and commit dates are converted.  The toool deduces what CVS
cvs2svn: modifications were made at the same time, and outputs these
cvs2svn: modifications grouped together as changesets in the target SCM.  It
cvs2svn: also deals with many CVS quirks and is highly configurable.
